# “Would You Rather?” Project

this project enables players to choose from the predefined users, they select the user of their choice then they can proceed to play.

Once the user logs in, the user is able to toggle between his/her answered and unanswered polls on the home page. The polls in both categories are arranged from the most recently created (top) to the least recently created (bottom).

A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather", they have two options. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this app, users are able to ask and answer questions, see which questions they have/haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

Upon voting in a poll, all of the information of an answered poll is displayed. The user’s response is recorded on the poll details page. Users can only vote once per poll; they are not allowed to change their answer after they’ve voted. When the user comes back to the home page, the polling question appears in the “Answered” column.
